# Digital Systems Class Repository

Welcome to my repository for the Digital Systems class! In this course, I worked with the Terasic DE10-Lite which is a Altera MAX 10 based FPGA board, a 32-bit Arm Cortex-M4 Wi-Fi® wireless MCU, to complete various labs. Additionally, I utilized Quartus, a programmable logic device design software, to write Verilog code and program the FPGA board, while also using ModelSim for result simulation. Below, you'll find information about the labs I completed during the course.

## Lab 1: Implementing Combinational Logic in the MAX10 FPGA
This lab consisted of 2 parts. Please refer to the [report]() for important information such as, simulated results, snippets, and more.
### Part 1
I decided to use the key buttons as input to the design. If both key buttons were off or
pressed, then the LED would be off. However, if one key button was pressed, while
the other button was not pressed, then the LEDR would turn on. I used a simple test bench to simulate the expected results.

### Part 2
I used 4 input switches, so there were 16 different possible inputs/outputs to the design. I took advantage of Karnaugh maps to help produce the sum of products for each output. The desired outputs were displayed
on the HEX display on the FPGA board. Addtionally, a test bench was created for simulating the results.
